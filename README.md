To run this application locally you will need to have node and npm up to date on your machine.  

To download Node: 
    https://nodejs.org/en/

npm documentation:
    https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

I suggest making sure you have the most current version of these running on your machine.
(For reference I am running npm version 9.2.0 and node 18.12.1)

Of note, you may want to run the following commands with sudo for mac, or as admin in a command prompt to avoid issues. This may not be necessary however. 

Once Node and npm are ready to go open a Terminal(Mac)/Command Prompt(Windows). 

Then cd into the project folder and run "npm i" 

To run SSR mode locally use 
    npm run dev:ssr
